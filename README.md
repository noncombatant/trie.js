# A Simple JavaScript Trie

This is a simple implementation of a trie in JavaScript. It can map any iterable
type (string, array, et c.) to any type.

It would be helpful if something like this were in the JavaScript standard
library. Itâ€™s surprisingly applicable in e.g. autocomplete UIs. Until then, you
can grab this, and package it up however is convenient for you.
